  # THIS IS THE ONLY force_ssl THAT DOES ANYTHING. IT MUST LIVE HERE.
  #
  # `:force_ssl` is a COMPILE-TIME endpoint option: Phoenix injects `plug
  # Plug.SSL, <these opts>` into the endpoint's pipeline in __before_compile__,
  # so the options are frozen into the compiled module. Setting `force_ssl` in
  # runtime.exs looks reasonable, is accepted without complaint, and is inert -
  # see the note left at that spot. Changing it here requires a rebuild, not
  # just a restart.
  #
  # WHY THE EXCLUDE LIST. Public traffic arrives through the nginx ingress,
  # which terminates TLS and sets X-Forwarded-Proto: https, so `rewrite_on` lets
  # it through. A pod calling the Service directly sets no such header, so
  # Plug.SSL answers 301 to https://phxlive.net (the redirect target is the
  # endpoint's :url host, which is why it is not the request host).
  #
  # For a browser that is invisible. For the game server's heartbeat POST it is
  # fatal, and the failure names neither TLS nor a redirect:
  #
  #   Connected to phoenix-web.phoenixapp.svc.cluster.local (10.96.162.255) port 80
  #   upload completely sent off: 194 bytes
  #   Clear auth, redirects to port from 80 to 443
  #   necessary data rewind was not possible
  #   libcurl error: 65 (Send failed since rewinding of the data stream failed)
  #
  # libcurl has already streamed the body and cannot rewind it to replay at the
  # new URL. Note "Clear auth" too: a cross-host redirect STRIPS the
  # Authorization header, so even a request that survived the rewind would
  # arrive with no server API key and be refused. Two failures, one redirect.
  #
  # Excluding these names is not a hole. The redirect protects a client that
  # would otherwise send credentials in plaintext across the internet; these
  # names resolve only inside the cluster, where the traffic never leaves the
  # node. "health" is pre-existing and inert (Plug.SSL matches on HOST, and no
  # request arrives with a Host of "health") - kept only so removing it is a
  # separate, deliberate decision.

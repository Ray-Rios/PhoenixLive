  # Single-session enforcement
  #
  # A character may be in at most one live world or instance at a time.
  #
  # THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES IS DATA LOSS, NOT CHEATING. `PreLoginAsync`
  # approved a join on the Holo-sim ACL and nothing else, so one character
  # could be signed in from several clients at once - observed five times in a
  # single run. `ARSSGameModeBase::Logout` writes a position checkpoint back
  # here on the way out, so two sessions racing one character means whichever
  # leaves last silently overwrites the other's progress.
  #
  # THREE THINGS RELEASE A CLAIM, and the redundancy is deliberate because each
  # one covers a failure the others cannot:
  #
  #   1. The server calls release when the player logs out. Immediate, and the
  #      normal case - a dedicated server sees a dropped connection right away.
  #   2. Heartbeat roster reconciliation. Every heartbeat carries who is on the
  #      server; anyone holding a claim there who is NOT in that roster is
  #      released. This covers a server that forgot to release, or lost the
  #      player without running its logout path, and self-heals within one
  #      heartbeat interval (~20 s).
  #   3. Server staleness. A claim held by a server whose heartbeat has gone
  #      quiet is simply not honoured, so a crashed shard cannot lock its
  #      players out of their own characters. Reuses `server_stale?/1`, so
  #      there is still exactly ONE definition of "alive" in this context.
  #
  # Without (2) and (3), the first crash of anything anywhere would leave a
  # character permanently unplayable with no way for the player to clear it.

  Claim a character for a server session. The join gate.

  Atomic by construction: the claimable test lives in the WHERE clause of a
  single UPDATE rather than in a read-then-write, so two clients racing the
  same character cannot both pass it. Exactly one row is affected or none is.

  Deliberately NOT relaxed for "the same server asking again". That looks like
  a harmless convenience - a reconnect to the shard you just dropped from -
  but every PIE client connects to the same world server on 127.0.0.1:7777, so
  a same-server exemption would make this a no-op in exactly the setup it most
  needs to work in. A genuine reconnect is covered by release-on-logout, and a
  hard drop by roster reconciliation, both of which free the claim properly
  rather than looking the other way.

  Returns:
    * `{:ok, %{character: character, session_id: id}}`
    * `{:error, :not_found}`     - no such character, or not this user's

  Queue a command for a server. It is delivered on that server's next heartbeat.

  Hand a server its undelivered commands and mark them delivered.

  AT-MOST-ONCE, on purpose. The alternative is holding them until the server
  acknowledges, which turns a missed response into a command that runs twice -
  and "kick" and "shutdown" are both considerably worse when repeated than when
  dropped. An admin can press the button again; they cannot un-kick anyone.

  Read and mark happen in one transaction so two overlapping heartbeats from a
  restarting server cannot both collect the same instruction.

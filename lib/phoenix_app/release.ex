  DB release tasks, for production where Mix is not installed.

  ## Why `create_db` used to do nothing on a live box

  `storage_up/1` answers `{:error, :already_up}` when the database is already
  there. That is the NORMAL answer on any server that has run before. The old
  code matched it against `:ok =`, so the very first repo raised a MatchError
  and the loop died — and because `PhoenixApp.Repo` is first in `:ecto_repos`,
  `PhoenixApp.GamesRepo` was never reached on any box that already had a main
  database.

  The result was a task that appeared to run, appeared to fail for a boring
  reason, and silently never created the games database at all:

      FATAL 3D000 (invalid_catalog_name) database "phoenix_games_prod" does not exist

  repeating once per connection-pool member, forever. Adding a repo to
  `:ecto_repos` is supposed to be all it takes; it was, everywhere except here.

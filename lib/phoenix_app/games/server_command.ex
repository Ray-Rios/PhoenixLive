defmodule PhoenixApp.Games.ServerCommand do
  @moduledoc """
  An instruction queued for a running game server, delivered on its next heartbeat.

  ## Why a queue and not a call

  Instances heartbeat outward; nothing can call into them. They may be behind
  NAT, inside a Kubernetes pod with no ingress, or started by hand on someone's
  desktop — all three are true at some point in this project's life. Rather than
  add a second transport just so an admin can press a button, the command rides
  back on the response to a request the server was already making.

  That has a property worth stating plainly: a command aimed at a server that
  has stopped heartbeating is never delivered and never expires by itself. That
  is correct — the server is gone, and the command was for that server — but it
  means the admin UI must show `delivered_at` rather than implying the button
  took effect.

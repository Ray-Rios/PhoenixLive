defmodule PhoenixApp.Games.GameCharacter do
  @moduledoc """
  A player's character within a specific game.

  `stats` and `settings` are flexible JSONB maps so each game (RaysSpaceSim,
  and future titles) can store its own shape of data without new migrations.
  Real-time gameplay state should live in the dedicated game server / Redis;
  this record is the periodic/disconnect checkpoint that gets persisted here.

  `user_id` intentionally has no foreign key constraint - it references the
  `users.id` in the main `PhoenixApp.Repo` database, which this repo cannot
  reference directly across databases.

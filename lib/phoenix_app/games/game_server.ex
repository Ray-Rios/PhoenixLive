defmodule PhoenixApp.Games.GameServer do
  @moduledoc """
  A registered dedicated game server (shard) for a title.

  Rows are written by the dedicated servers themselves via a heartbeat, never
  by players — see `PhoenixAppWeb.Api.GamesController.heartbeat_server/2`,
  which refuses anything not authenticated with the server API key. If a
  player could write here they could advertise a server they control to every
  other player, which is a phishing vector rather than a cheat.

  Liveness is heartbeat-based, not shutdown-based. A crashed server never gets
  the chance to deregister, so the presence of a row means nothing on its own;
  only `last_heartbeat_at` being recent does.
